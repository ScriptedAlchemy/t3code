# Codex

Use a Codex CLI account or ChatGPT subscription sharing to code in T3 Code.

## Use hosted inference accounts

Choose **Settings > Providers > Inference accounts** to sign in on one host and run Codex threads on environments paired over Tailscale or your trusted LAN. Each thread keeps its workspace and tools on the environment where it runs. [Host and share inference accounts](./providers-claude.md#host-and-share-inference-accounts)

## Connect with ChatGPT sharing

Connect during onboarding or in **Settings → Providers**. For a remote machine,
select that environment first. T3 Code handles Codex installation; sign in on
OpenAI and allow sharing of your ChatGPT plan.

Manage shared usage and credits in ChatGPT through **Manage usage** in T3 Code.
If a request uses a feature that ChatGPT sharing does not support, use another
provider for that request.

Fast and Ultrafast speeds are unavailable with this connection. To use the speed
options your account supports, [use an existing Codex login](#use-an-existing-codex-login).

When reconnecting, choose the same account in T3 Code and on OpenAI's sign-in
page. Disconnecting stops running threads but keeps their history and lets you
reconnect later.

If remote sign-in cannot return automatically, paste the full URL from the final
localhost page into the sign-in panel, even if that page could not load.

## Use an existing Codex login

Choose **Use existing Codex CLI** when adding the provider to use the CLI's current
login and settings. Run `codex login` on the environment's machine to sign in.
[Provider setup](./install.md#providers) covers installation and custom configuration.

## Use Traex bridge

Run traex-bridge at `127.0.0.1:8317` on the selected environment's macOS or Linux
machine. Store its API key in `~/.traex-bridge/api-key` on that machine.
In **Settings > Providers**, choose **Add provider**, then **Traex**.
The preset uses Codex from that machine's PATH or a copy T3 Code has installed.
To use another executable, set its path in **Config**.

Traex stores its sessions and configuration in a separate Codex home.

## Use multiple accounts

Add accounts on the inference host, then turn on **Use CLI proxy** for Codex on each environment that needs them. Threads keep using the normal Codex provider and model names. While the proxy is on, other Codex accounts on that environment are hidden; turn it off to use an individual CLI login again. [Host and share inference accounts](./providers-claude.md#host-and-share-inference-accounts)

## Answer questions while Codex works

Codex can ask a question and keep working. Answer it in the thread's question
panel. The answer becomes a new message: it reaches the active turn, or starts
another turn if Codex has finished. Unanswered questions survive reconnects.
If you do not want to answer, dismiss the question from its panel. Dismissing
closes it without sending anything to Codex. This requires a Codex version that
supports async questions.

## Use Mac apps

If your Codex instance already has native Computer Use configured and enabled,
ask it to work in a Mac app, such as Calculator. Computer Use controls the server
environment's Mac, even when you connect from another computer or your phone.
Native permissions and confirmation requests still apply.

## Approve app access

Codex tools can request access to another app. Respond to the named app's request
in the thread on web, desktop, or mobile. Some tools offer access for one request,
the current session, or permanently. See [Permission modes](./permission-modes.md)
for command and file approvals.

## Codex says I hit a usage limit

When Codex stops on a usage limit, the thread names the window that ran out and
when it resets, when Codex reports them. Send the message again after the reset. On a workspace plan the
message also says whether your workspace owner needs to add credits or raise the
spend limit to continue sooner.

## Send feedback to OpenAI

In an existing Codex thread, send `/feedback` with an optional description, for
example `/feedback The agent stopped before finishing the tests`. This uploads
the conversation and Codex logs to OpenAI. The returned thread ID can be shared
with OpenAI support.
