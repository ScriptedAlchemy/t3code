# Set up pstack

[Guide](./README.md) · Next: [Poteto mode](./02-poteto-mode.md)

## Enable the pack

T3 Code owns the pstack runtime pack and exposes `$pstack:` composer chips when pstack is enabled. Select `$pstack:poteto-mode` for a task. This native port is intended to replace the upstream pack at the server's vendoring boundary; it is not a marketplace plugin to install separately in each harness. See the repository README for integration status.

## Choose your models

Run `$pstack:setup-pstack`. It reads the available providers and asks for a reasoning budget: unlimited, large, medium, or small. Confirm the 17 role choices, including each panel's seats. The models file belongs to this environment and applies on the next invocation. Another environment needs its own choices.

During a run, T3 supplies the absolute pack and models paths and exact resolved role targets in `<t3_pstack>`. Skills use those targets. An inherited seat runs on the parent model. Missing required roles stop the affected spawn.

## Run your first task

Attach `$pstack:poteto-mode` and describe the outcome, for example `fix the stale project title after reconnect`. The parent selects a playbook, tracks its steps, delegates bounded work, and verifies the result. Attach the skill to each new task. There is no sticky mode to enable.

Use `$pstack:poteto-help` for routing. Read [understand](./03-understand.md), [design](./04-design.md), or [verify and ship](./06-verify-and-ship.md) for focused workflows. Long runs need a checkable finish condition; [overnight](./07-overnight.md) covers event wakes and scheduled checks.
