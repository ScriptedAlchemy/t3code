### Autonomous run

**You own the exit condition. Define done, then drive to it without stopping.**

1. State the exit condition as a checkable predicate before the first iteration (tests green, repro fixed, all N PRs merged, pixel-diff zero).
2. Pick an event wake: `watch_pull_request` for PR checks, reviews, and conflicts; child completions for delegated work. End the turn after arming it. Where no supported event exists, use `schedule_task` with an interval (`everyMs` at least 60000) or fixed time, including the absolute pack/models paths and relevant resolved roles in the prompt. Report cadence and `nextRunAt`, retain `scheduledTaskId`, and delete it with `delete_scheduled_task` once the predicate holds. Use one long heartbeat only when a fallback is needed, never a watcher agent or sleep loop.
3. Each iteration makes the smallest change the evidence justifies, verifies it against the predicate, commits if it advanced, discards changes that didn't help. Belt-and-suspenders that "might help" gets reverted, not left to ride.
   Sequence the work via the **sequence-verifiable-units** principle skill, verifying each unit before the next instead of batching checks at the end.
4. Mid-run discoveries are yours. Address broken skills, related bugs, flaky verifiers, review noise, tooling failures, orphaned follow-ups, and fixable drift yourself via poteto-mode. Put out-of-band fixes in their own PR. Do not park reversible work for the human or use the harness question tool. Surface only irreversible actions, genuine product or preference calls no experiment can settle, or a real dead end. Keep the predicate as the main drive, and return to it after each side fix.
5. Checkpoint every iteration via the **show-me-your-work** skill, a row for what changed and whether the predicate moved.
6. Stop when the predicate is met. A plateau is not a stop, so keep going and pivot your approach to push past it. Surface a genuine dead end rather than spinning, and never relax the predicate to declare victory.

**Reply:** the exit condition, iterations run, what landed, what was discarded, final predicate state.
