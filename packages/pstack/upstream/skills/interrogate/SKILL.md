# Interrogate

Use `delegate_task` for every spawn. Arena runners, architect runners, and interrogate reviewers are panels: one child per seat, including fallbacks. An `unavailable` seat is not a target: retain its panel position, refresh capabilities, report the blocked seat, and do not launch it until a valid target is resolved. Every other role is a pool: pick the seat whose model best fits the job; spread same-role children in a wave across seats. Arena cross-judges prefer a different model family. Copy the chosen target from `<t3_pstack>` exactly, including all options; `inherit` means the parent model and omits `target`. If a pool spawn is rejected, report it and try the next seat; never invent targets or change options. Repeat fallback notes and report provider, model, or option mismatches. If a required role is missing, stop that spawn. Call `orchestrator_capabilities` before the first delegation and again when availability changes or a target is rejected. Resolved roles are a snapshot. An explicit user change supersedes it; validate the requested target and options against fresh capabilities. After setup writes new choices, do not reuse the older snapshot for changed roles. Start each brief with the absolute `<pstack>` and `<models>` paths; include the relevant resolved role lines when children will delegate. Retain every `taskId`. With `mode: "async"`, spawn the wave and end the turn; completion wakes the parent. Do not poll children. Use `mode: "wait"` only when this turn needs the result; a wait timeout does not cancel the child. Cancel replaced or unneeded work with `task_cancel`.

Adversaries try to break a change or a design. A finding survives only when a run proves it. Report the findings. Do not apply fixes.

## Frame

The scope is what the user names. Otherwise it is the branch diff from its merge base with the base branch, through the working tree. State the intent with the **in-your-own-words** skill, from the user's message, the commits, and the PR description. Ask the user when the intent is unclear.

## Fan out

Run Phase A steps 3 and 4 and Phase B of the **arena** skill, with four changes. Use every resolved `interrogate reviewers` seat from `<t3_pstack>` in place of `arena runners`, including inherited seats. Each adversary uses `delegate_task`, `role: "review"`, and `isolation: "worktree"`. A worktree begins at the committed local HEAD. When the scope includes uncommitted changes, save a patch to an absolute shared path and ask each adversary to apply it in its own worktree before running the repro; report if the needed files cannot be made available. Do not commit, push, or alter the parent's checkout. In place of the arena task and rationale, give each adversary the scope, the intent, and this brief:

> Break this change. Prove each finding with a run against the real code, such as a failing test, a repro script, or command output that shows the wrong behavior. For a design or plan, run a prototype or probe the current tree. Keep repros in your own worktree. Report each finding with a title, the exact command, the output it printed, and the output the intent requires. Leave out anything you did not run. That covers style, naming, structure, and risks that need a future change to matter. No findings is a valid result.

## Verify

Verify each finding per arena Phase F by rerunning its command. Keep a finding when the output shows the failure and the failure breaks the intent. Drop the rest. Merge findings that share a root cause.

Skip arena Phases C, D, and E. Adversaries find different failures, so the verdict keeps every verified finding, not one adversary's list.

## Output

- **Intent**: the restatement.
- **Findings**: for each verified finding, the command, its output, how it breaks the intent, and the adversaries that found it. Say "no verified findings" when none survive.
- **Dropped**: for each adversary, the count of dropped findings and why.
