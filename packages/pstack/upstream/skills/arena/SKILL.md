# Arena

Use `delegate_task` for every spawn. Arena runners, architect runners, and interrogate reviewers are panels: one child per seat, including fallbacks. Every other role is a pool: pick the seat whose model best fits the job; spread same-role children in a wave across seats. Arena cross-judges prefer a different model family. Copy the chosen target from `<t3_pstack>` exactly, including all options; `inherit` means the parent model and omits `target`. If a pool spawn is rejected, report it and try the next seat; never invent targets or change options. Repeat fallback notes and report provider, model, or option mismatches. If a required role is missing, stop that spawn. Call `orchestrator_capabilities` once before the first delegation. Start each brief with the absolute `<pstack>` and `<models>` paths; include the relevant resolved role lines when children will delegate. Retain every `taskId`. With `mode: "async"`, spawn the wave and end the turn; completion wakes the parent. Do not poll children. Use `mode: "wait"` only when this turn needs the result; a wait timeout does not cancel the child. Cancel replaced or unneeded work with `task_cancel`.

Open a plan using the harness plan tool, or a list in the reply with one entry per phase (Frame, Fan out, Cross-judge, Pick, Graft, Verify) before launching anything.

## Phase A: Frame

Every candidate gets the same prompt, so the prompt is the contract.

1. State the artifact each candidate is producing.
2. Derive the rubric, 3-6 concrete gradeable criteria for what success looks like on *this* task. It is the picker's tool in Phase D. Candidates only see the task.
3. Pick one runner per resolved seat of `arena runners` in `<t3_pstack>`, including `inherit` seats. Keep the panel size and targets. For multiple design directions, give each seat a direction; reuse seats for additional generation rounds when needed.

4. Give each candidate its own output location. Use `isolation: "worktree"` for independent repository edits; its base is the parent checkout's committed local HEAD. Uncommitted files are unavailable. Arrange the committed base within the task's authorization before spawning, or report that placement cannot be honored. For non-repository artifacts use `/tmp/arena-<slug>/candidate-<n>/`.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn all N subagents in one message with `mode: "async"`, each with the task, the path to the shared grounding, its own output path, and instructions to produce the artifact and a short rationale naming the alternatives it considered and what it rejected.

If a candidate produces no output, proceed with N-1 and note the dropout.

## Phase C: Cross-judge

After all Phase B candidates complete, choose one resolved seat from `arena cross-judge pool` in `<t3_pstack>`. Prefer a model family different from the parent, using `inheritedModel` from `orchestrator_capabilities` for an inherited seat. Set `role: "review"` and say "Do not edit files, commit, or push." The judge sees the rubric and candidates by path label, scores each criterion, and recommends a base with rationale. Run alongside your Phase D reading; never while candidates are still writing. Make candidate outputs accessible by committed paths or absolute shared artifact paths.

## Phase D: Pick a base

Read every candidate end to end before picking. Score each against the rubric criterion by criterion, not on holistic feel, and compare with the cross-judge. Agreement on the base confirms the pick. Disagreement means one of you is biased or the rubric was ambiguous. Read both rationales before deciding.

Pick the base a future maintainer can extend most easily without breaking invariants. When two feel tied, prefer the cleaner boundary or smaller API, per the Laziness Protocol.

## Phase E: Graft

Walk each losing candidate once more for what is worth porting into the base, usually one or two things per candidate, not most of it. Fold each graft in by hand, per the **redesign-from-first-principles** principle skill, so the result stays coherent under one mental model. Don't paste mechanically.

If the candidates converge on one shape, that is strong agreement. Note it and ship the consensus shape. No graft is needed. If they wildly diverge, Phase A was under-specified. Reframe and re-run rather than averaging the divergence.

## Phase F: Verify

Verify the synthesized artifact like any other output, per the **prove-it-works** principle skill. If verification finds a problem the arena missed, either Phase A was wrong (re-frame and re-run) or a candidate caught it and you missed the graft (go back to Phase E). Don't paper over it.

## Outputs

One synthesized artifact, with a short synthesis note alongside naming the base and why, the cross-judge's verdict, each graft with its source candidate, what was rejected and why, any convergence or dropouts, and the verification result.
